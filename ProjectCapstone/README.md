### This jupiter notebook requires dozens of other files (pickles, h5, html, .py, etc) to work properly. Due to the file sizes, I have to zip them up into 4 Archive zip files:
<br><br>
Archive 1 - miscellaneous files including .py, html, model pickle files<br>
Archive 2 - original data set and intermediate pickle files<br>
Archive 3 - Word2Vec models (900mb after uncompressing)<br>
Archive 4 - training and test data frames for Regression model (12 Gb after uncompressing)<br>

<br><br>
Archive 1 can be downloaded here. Links to download Archive 2 - 4 are provided below: <br><br>

Archive 2 - https://www.dropbox.com/s/vjyqep3b988watk/Archive2.zip?dl=0
<br><br>
Archive 3 - https://www.dropbox.com/s/0e6rl2dhn4jrd0y/Archive3%20-%20900mb%20when%20uncompressed.zip?dl=0
<br><br>
Archive 4 - https://www.dropbox.com/s/03k0l3hj06h63xg/Archive4%20-%2012Gb%20when%20uncompressed.zip?dl=0

### Unzip them into the same folder as the jupyter notebook
