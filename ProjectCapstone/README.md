## Wine Reviews Writer - ### Jupyter notebook containing the code to analyse the text corpus of a wine reviews dataset from Kaggle. In it, I also trained a Gated Recurrent Unit network to artificially generate human-readable wine reviews.

#### HTML formatting is heavily used in the ipython notebook for the purpose of readability and aesthetics. Github cannot render some of the html tags used in it. Hence it will just display the raw code. Do try to download the notebook to your local computer to open in Jupyter Notebook. Hope it gives you a more enjoyable reading experience!


#### Also, this Jupyter notebook requires many other files (pickles, h5, html, .py, etc) to work properly. Due to the file sizes, I have to zip them up into 4 Archive zip files:
<br><br>
Archive 1 - miscellaneous files including .py, html, model pickle files<br>
Archive 2 - original data set and intermediate pickle files<br>
Archive 3 - Word2Vec models (900mb after uncompressing)<br>
Archive 4 - training and test data frames for Regression model (12 Gb after uncompressing)<br>

<br><br>
Archive 1 can be downloaded here. Links to download Archive 2 - 4 are provided below: <br><br>

Archive 2 - https://www.dropbox.com/s/vjyqep3b988watk/Archive2.zip?dl=0
<br><br>
Archive 3 - https://www.dropbox.com/s/0e6rl2dhn4jrd0y/Archive3%20-%20900mb%20when%20uncompressed.zip?dl=0
<br><br>
Archive 4 - https://www.dropbox.com/s/03k0l3hj06h63xg/Archive4%20-%2012Gb%20when%20uncompressed.zip?dl=0

### Unzip them into the same folder as the jupyter notebook
