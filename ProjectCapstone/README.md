### This jupiter notebook requires dozens of other files (pickles, h5, html, .py, etc) to work properly. Due to the file sizes, I have to zip them up into 4 Archive zip files:
<br><br>
Archive 1 - miscellaneous files including .py, html, model pickle files<br>
Archive 2 - original data set and intermediate pickle files<br>
Archive 3 - Word2Vec models (900mb after uncompressing)<br>
Archive 4 - training and test data frames for Regression model (12 Gb after uncompressing)<br>

<br><br>
Archive 1 is able to be stored here. links to download Archive 2 - 4 are provided
